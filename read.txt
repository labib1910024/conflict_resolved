Conflict generally arise when two people have changed the same line in a file or if a developer deleted a file while another developer was modifying  it. In this cases  Git cannot automatically determine what is correct. Conflicts only affects the developer conducting the merge, the reset  of the team  is unaware of the conflict. Git will mark the file as being conflicted and the merging process. It is then developers responsibility to resolve the conflict.
Happy Coding
